# Blog

This is the source code for my static blog, located at <http://synesthesiam.com>.
My blog is written with the [Nikola](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/) static blog generator.

## IPython Notebook Script

I've written a small Python script to convert [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html) to blog posts (`notebook2post.py`). This script takes a notebook and a Markdown preamble as input, and outputs a complete Markdown blog post. Check out my `Makefile` for an example of how to use it!
